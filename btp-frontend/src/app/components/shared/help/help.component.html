      <h2><strong>1 &nbsp;&nbsp; About the Process</strong></h2>
      <hr />
      <br />
      <mat-card-content>
        <p>
          There are three types of users namely
          <b>Student, Faculty, Super Admin</b>. And there are four roles namely
          <b>Student, Faculty, Co-ordinator, Super Admin</b>. We will have a
          quick glance on how the process works. We will go through these roles
          in detail first.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h4>Students</h4>
            <p>
              No special priviliges given. They have to give their preferences
              of projects.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h4>Faculty</h4>
            <p>
              No special priviliges given. Faculty have to select the programs
              which they wish to support i.e the programs in which they would
              like to float their projects. They are responsible for giving the
              student preference for the projects they floated.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h4>Co-ordinator</h4>
            <p>
              Co-ordinator has to import the student list containing
              Name,Rollno.,CGPA of each student in csv format in the
              Manage->Students tab to enable the students to register. Note that
              students not present in this list wont be able to register.
              Presets help to control the number of students assigned to each
              faculty. These are assigned by the Co-ordinator of each program
              and is unique to a program. Co-ordinator is responsible for
              setting the deadlines of the programs. Mails can be sent to the
              particular groups of users about the deadline. Please note that
              this is not automated for any of the stages i.e you have to click
              the Send Mails button.
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <h4>Presets</h4>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <b>Project Cap</b>: This is the maximum number of projects
                    each faculty can float. This is not set to anything in the
                    start. If not set, no faculty will be able to add projects.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Student Cap</b>: This is the maximum number of students
                    each project can intake. This is set to 1 by default.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <b>Students Per Faculty</b>: This is the maximum number of
                    students each faculty can intake considering all the
                    projects they floated. This is not set to anything in the
                    start.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                    who opted for the program.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Co-ordinator can remove any student or faculty who opted for
                    that program.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Co-ordinator has the access to deadlines and can change
                    deadlines.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h4>Super Admin</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Super Admin has the access to the database.
              </li>
              <li>
                Super Admin is responsible for selecting the program
                Co-ordinators before the start of the Allocation.
              </li>
              <li>
                They have the privilige to add programs.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <br />
        <h4>Flow of the Process</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Super Admin has to add the respective programs and streams.
          </li>

          <li>
            All the faculty members have to register to the portal choosing
            their respective stream. If your stream is not present in the
            registraion page please contact the Super Admin to add it.
          </li>

          <li>
            Super Admin has to then choose a Co-ordinator to each program. Do
            note that one faculty member can behave as a Co-ordinator only for
            one program.
          </li>

          <li>
            Each Co-ordinator has to then import the student list in a csv file
            containing Name,Rollno.,CGPA of each student. Do note that only the
            students in this list will be able to register to the portal.
            Students not in this list wont be able to register to the portal.
          </li>

          <li>
            The Co-ordinators of each program have to start the allocation by
            setting the first deadline and fillng in the presets. On setting the
            first deadine the stages start i.e it will go to stage 1.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Start of Stage 1</b>
          </li>
          <li>

          <li>
            Co-ordinators have to proceed to the next stage by hitting the
            proceed button. Co-ordinators have to make sure that no faculty have
            violated the presets, otherwise you wont be able to move to the next
            stage. Note that there are some violations which have to be resolved
            in the Manage->Faculty tab otherwise you wont be able to proceed to
            the next stage.
          </li>

        <h2><strong>2 &nbsp;&nbsp; Stages</strong></h2>
        <hr />
        <br />
        <p>
          The project allocation consists of four stages namely Creating
          Projects, Student Preference, Faculty Preference and Project
          Allocation. This is a quick overview as to understand the process.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h4>Stage 1 : Creating Projects</h4>
            <p>
              In this stage :
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                The faculty can <b>ADD/EDIT/DELETE</b> projects. Note that these
                options will be disabled in the further stages.
              </li>
              <li>
                Sometimes you wont be able to add any projects because you may
                be violating certain presets set by the Co-ordinator of that
                program. In such case you need to communicate with the
                Co-ordinator and take necessary steps.
              </li>
              <li>
                The Save Preferences button in the Students Tab in each project
                will be disabled. Please refrain from clicking it.
              </li>
              <li>
                Students preferences will be locked i.e students wont be able to
                edit their preferences.
              </li>
              <li>
                Sometimes you will be logged out of the application. Dont worry
                this is because of session expiry or because of any server
                error. In the later case please contact us.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <h4>Stage 2 : Student Preferences</h4>
            <p>
              In this stage :
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Faculty's <b>ADD/EDIT/DELETE</b> options are disabled from this
                stage and through out.
              </li>
              <li>
                Students can now give their preferences.
                <b
                  >Please do note that if you dont give any preference, you will
                  be alloted a random project</b
                >.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <h4>Stage 3 : Faculty Preferences</h4>
            <p>
              In this stage :
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Faculty have to give their preference in the Student tab in each
                project section. You can Save Preferences how many ever times
                you want. Note that the latest save will be considered for the
                allocation.
              </li>
              <li>
                Faculty also have to select a final list of projects from all the projects they floated which they finally want to offer.
              </li>
              <li>
                Students wont be able to edit their preferences further.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <h4>Stage 4 : Project Allocation</h4>
            <p>
              In this stage :
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Project Allocation allocates program wise, and after the
                allocation make sure to click on the <b>Publish to Faculty</b> and the <b>Publish to Students</b> button to send
                mails to all the members involved in that particular program
                indicating the end of the allocation and to publish the details of the allocation to the respective group.
              </li>
              <li>
                Now you can exclude projects from the allocation by deselecting
                them in the Project tab. Go through the video to understand this
                better.
              </li>
              <li>
                Students will be able to see their project alloted in their home
                page. It will appear as an expansion panel in place of the
                timeline.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>

            <b><u>Streams Tab</u></b> : This tab is for adding any new streams in the institute.

                    The “+” button on the top of the table can be used to add a new branch and the delete button can be used to remove the branch.

            <b><u>Programs Tab</u></b> : This tab is for adding any new programs within the provided streams.

                    This tab requires mapping to the roll.no of the students of that particular program. The “+” button on the top of the table can be used to add a new
                    program and the delete button can be used to remove the program.

            <b><u>Explanation:</u></b>

                Now let us consider that IIT Palakkad has four core streams
                    1. Computer Science and Engineering(CSE)
                    2. Electrical Engineering(EE)
                    3. Mechanical Engineering(ME)
                    4. Civil Engineering(CE)

                The above four streams must be added one by one in the streams tab:

                <b>For CSE:</b>

                    name : Computer Science and Engineering
                    short :  CSE
                    Similarly the other streams can be added.



                Now these streams further contain many programs such as UG, PG etc. For now let us consider that there are only two programs UG and PG.

                These programs will have to be registered under the programs tab.
                    Click on the “+” button to add programs  and in the pop-up fill in the required details.
                    Example:
                        Let us consider the UG and PG programs must be added in the CSE stream.
                        Now click on “+” button, In the pop-up the fill the required details,

                <b>For UG:</b>

                    Name: UG-Computer Science and Engineering or any other suitable name.
                    Short: UG-CSE or any other suitable name. (allowed characters are letters, underscore and hyphen).
                    Map: This field needs a simple regex to identify the students of that particular program from their roll number.
                    Example:
                        For UG-CSE the current roll numbers are 111801***
                        So here the map would be 0|11
                        For UG-EE the current roll numbers are 121801***
                        So here the map would be 0|12


                    <b><u>Split up of the map:</u></b>

                    The numbers to the left of the pipe('|') must tell the number of characters in the roll number before the occurrence of the unique pattern for that
                    program.
                    For UG-CSE, UG-EE, UG-ME, UG-CE the roll numbers are 11…, 12…., 13…., 10… respectively the unique patterns are 11,12,13,10 respectively and the
                    number of characters before that is 0 so the map for each program would be 0|11, 0|12, 0|13, 0|10 respectively.

                    Similarly the CSE program for PG can also be added.
