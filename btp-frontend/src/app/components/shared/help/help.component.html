            <mat-card-content>
                <p>
                    There are three types of users namely
                    <b>Student, Faculty, Super Admin</b>. And there are four roles namely
                    <b>Student, Faculty, Co-ordinator, Super Admin</b>. We will have a quick glance on how the process works. We will go through these roles in detail first.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Students</h4>
                        <p>
                            No special priviliges given. They have to give their preferences of projects. </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h4>Faculty</h4>
                        <p>
                            No special priviliges given. Faculty have to select the programs which they wish to support i.e the programs in which they would like to float their projects. They are responsible for giving the student preference for the projects they floated. </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h4>Co-ordinator</h4>
                        <p>
                            Co-ordinator has to import the student list containing Name,Rollno.,CGPA of each student in csv format in the Manage->Students tab to enable the students to register. Note that students not present in this list wont be able to register. Presets help to control the number of students assigned to each faculty. These are assigned by the Co-ordinator of each program and is unique to a program. Co-ordinator is responsible for setting the deadlines of the programs. Mails can be sent to the particular groups of users about the deadline. Please note that this is not automated for any of the stages i.e you have to click the Send Mails button. </p>

                        Super Admin has to add the respective programs and streams.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        All the faculty members have to register to the portal choosing their respective stream. If your stream is not present in the registraion page please contact the Super Admin to add it.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Super Admin has to then choose a Co-ordinator to each program. Do note that one faculty member can behave as a Co-ordinator only for one program.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Each Co-ordinator has to then import the student list in a csv file containing Name,Rollno.,CGPA of each student. Do note that only the students in this list will be able to register to the portal. Students not in this list wont be able to register to the portal.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        The Co-ordinators of each program have to start the allocation by setting the first deadline and fillng in the presets. On setting the first deadine the stages start i.e it will go to stage 1.

                <hr />
                <br />
                <p>
                    The project allocation consists of four stages namely Creating Projects, Student Preference, Faculty Preference and Project Allocation. This is a quick overview as to understand the process. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Stage 1 : Creating Projects</h4>
                        <p>In this stage :</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                The faculty can
                                <b>ADD/EDIT/DELETE</b> projects. Note that these options will be disabled in the further stages.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Sometimes you wont be able to add any projects because you may be violating certain presets set by the Co-ordinator of that program. In such case you need to communicate with the Co-ordinator and take necessary steps.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The Save Preferences button in the Students Tab in each project will be disabled. Please refrain from clicking it.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Students preferences will be locked i.e students wont be able to edit their preferences.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Sometimes you will be logged out of the application. Dont worry this is because of session expiry or because of any server error. In the later case please contact us.

                    <li>
                        <h4>Stage 2 : Student Preferences</h4>
                        <p>In this stage :</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>

                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Students can now give their preferences.
                                <b>Please do note that if you dont give any preference, you will be alloted a random project</b>.
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                            <li>
                                Faculty also have to select a final list of projects from all the projects they floated which they finally want to offer.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Students wont be able to edit their preferences further.

                            <li>
                                Project Allocation allocates program wise, and after the allocation make sure to click on the
                                <b>Publish to Faculty</b> and the
                                <b>Publish to Students</b> button to send mails to all the members involved in that particular program indicating the end of the allocation and to publish the details of the allocation to the respective group.
                            </li>
                            <li>

            <b><u>Streams Tab</u></b> : This tab is for adding any new streams in the institute.

                    The “+” button on the top of the table can be used to add a new branch and the delete button can be used to remove the branch.

            <b><u>Programs Tab</u></b> : This tab is for adding any new programs within the provided streams.

                    This tab requires mapping to the roll.no of the students of that particular program. The “+” button on the top of the table can be used to add a new
                    program and the delete button can be used to remove the program.

            <b><u>Explanation:</u></b>

                Now let us consider that IIT Palakkad has four core streams
                    1. Computer Science and Engineering(CSE)
                    2. Electrical Engineering(EE)
                    3. Mechanical Engineering(ME)
                    4. Civil Engineering(CE)

                The above four streams must be added one by one in the streams tab:

                <b>For CSE:</b>

                    name : Computer Science and Engineering
                    short :  CSE
                    Similarly the other streams can be added.



                Now these streams further contain many programs such as UG, PG etc. For now let us consider that there are only two programs UG and PG.

                These programs will have to be registered under the programs tab.
                    Click on the “+” button to add programs  and in the pop-up fill in the required details.
                    Example:
                        Let us consider the UG and PG programs must be added in the CSE stream.
                        Now click on “+” button, In the pop-up the fill the required details,

                <b>For UG:</b>

                    Name: UG-Computer Science and Engineering or any other suitable name.
                    Short: UG-CSE or any other suitable name. (allowed characters are letters, underscore and hyphen).
                    Map: This field needs a simple regex to identify the students of that particular program from their roll number.
                    Example:
                        For UG-CSE the current roll numbers are 111801***
                        So here the map would be 0|11
                        For UG-EE the current roll numbers are 121801***
                        So here the map would be 0|12


                    <b><u>Split up of the map:</u></b>

                    The numbers to the left of the pipe('|') must tell the number of characters in the roll number before the occurrence of the unique pattern for that
                    program.
                    For UG-CSE, UG-EE, UG-ME, UG-CE the roll numbers are 11…, 12…., 13…., 10… respectively the unique patterns are 11,12,13,10 respectively and the
                    number of characters before that is 0 so the map for each program would be 0|11, 0|12, 0|13, 0|10 respectively.

                    Similarly the CSE program for PG can also be added.
